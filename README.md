**Plushie Friends** is a Fabric and NeoForge mod that lets you turn players into cute, collectible 3D plushies to decorate your world!

*   **Skins Don't Change:** They work just like vanilla player heads. The plushie grabs a player's skin the moment it's made and locks it in. If that player updates their skin later, your plushie stays exactly the same as a neat little time capsule.
*   **Cute 3D Models:** The plushies have detailed little heads, bodies, arms, and legs that automatically turn to face whichever way you place them down.
*   **Name Tags:** Hovering over a plushie in your inventory shows the owner's name in a clean, colored text so you don't lose track of who is who.
*   **Great for Modpacks:** Fully supports datapacks, making it easy for pack creators add player plushies into loot chests. You can find a guide [here](https://wiki.thesalad.bar/mods/plushie-friends/datapack/).
